# Overview
We will be exploring the public data set that Google BigQuery has provided us. In particular we will be looking at the 2018 Yellow Taxi trips and the weather data set together. Please note that the notebook cannot be run locally, it needs to be run on a cluster. I personally ran this on a cluster I created using GCP.
